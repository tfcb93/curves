# Curves

Curves is a project to experiment with HTML canvas, Bezier curves and animation.

That's it. There is nothing more to add so far.

I might add other stuff (and make a fancier instructions card at the start) later.

To run the project, clone/download it and, in the folder, run:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
